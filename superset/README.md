# Superset
Apache Superset is an open-source software for exploring and visualizing data, designed for big data.

## About data
Below is an example of my dashboards made based on data from a messenger application with a news feed. Real data is updated every minute, so it is important to have charts not only for past periods but also for today in order to compare with previous time periods and see how our metrics are doing. Luckily, the Apache Superset toolkit allows for this. So we have two tables, all user events with the news feed and all events with the messenger, respectively.

## Example of my dashboards
The main question that analytics should answer at the very beginning is "how much?". In practice, this means that if we were tasked with setting up product analytics, we need to start with several basic dashboards that cover key audience metrics and key events of our product. In the lecture, we laid the foundation for two dashboards for the news feed, and now your task is to complete these dashboards. Think about what other charts, slices, and metrics make sense to add to the dashboards. Where to start? Perhaps, for example, it is worth displaying the number of events per user in some way?

1) Main dashboard for past time.
